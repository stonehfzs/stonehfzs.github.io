## About
During the process of learning, I have written some lecture notes for some courses. Most are hand-written version due to limited time for LaTex editing. The provided notes are consistent with the course, while not similar with the reference book that also provided.

I'm also planning to set up seminars for bachelors with some mates, the materials would also be updated here as a reference for learning.

For courses before 2024 Fall, the notes are need to be updated so other materials are provided.

**[2024 Fall Probability & Statistics Lecture Notes (Not Recommended)](https://stonehfzs.github.io/notes/2024_Fall_PnS.pdf)**

## Remark
Not recommended means the material is not well organized or I'm not fully satisfied with the sturcture of the notes.
